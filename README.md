## ðŸš€ About Me
Hey up! I am souvik, this is my very first project with `HTML`,`CSS` and `Javascript`.

I am very happy to say that , I was literally nothing just 1-2 months back but now as I am taking more and more knowledge, I can say that I am on the way to a Full stack developer..
Thanks to those youtubers who made it possible...



## Roadmap

- Learn `HTML`,`CSS` and `Javascript`.
- start enjoying.



## Javascript code

Copy the code

```bash
 setInterval(()=>{
 d= new Date();
 htime= d.getHours()
 mtime=d.getMinutes()
 stime= d.getSeconds()

 hrotaion= 30*htime + mtime/2;
 mrotaion= 6* mtime;
 srotation=6 * stime;

 hour.style.transform=`rotate(${hrotaion}deg)`
 minute.style.transform=`rotate(${mrotaion}deg)`
 second.style.transform=`rotate(${srotation}deg)`

},1000);
```
